# Apache Milagro (incubating) Docs Repo README

To get going, please read the Wiki attached to this repository.

The Wiki is a short compendium on how to get up to speed on GitHub and some rules and processes we need to follow to generate content.
To get up to speed and get productive, make sure you complete all the steps in the wiki.

This should take you no more than an hour.

However, Git as a protocol is something you learn to do, like operating Microsoft Word.

The good news is there are plenty of resources to help you get up to speed.

To get to the Wiki home page, click on the Wiki icon to the right of this text. Just hover over the icons to the right until you find the Wiki icon and click on it.
